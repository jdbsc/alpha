Below is a brief summary of some of the Matlab routines, please
examine the routines themselves for more info --- within each routine
there should be ample documentation on how to use it.  Also the file
"example.m," shows how you might call these routines from within your
program.



Routines (subroutines are nested below main routines):

% Beta MWM 
train_beta_mwm --- Finds betaMWM model parameters for an input data set.
   get_wave_stats --- Calculates wavelet coefficient 2nd-order statistics. 
      haardwt            ---  Calculates the Haar wavelet transform.
   get_beta_pars  --- Converts 2nd-order statistics into beta parameters.

train_ss_beta_mwm --- Fit betaMWM to 2nd-order self-similar data (theoretical)
   get_ss_wave_stats.m --- Calculates theoretical 2nd-order wavelet statistics
                           for self-similar data 

gen_beta_mwm   --- Generates realization of the betaMWM given model parameters.

mwm_msq   --- Computes approximations to the tail queue probability for the 
	      Beta MWM.

% Point-mass MWM
train_pm_mwm --- Finds point-mass MWM model parameters for an input data set.
   get_moment_stats --- Calculates signal moments (2nd and -1st).
   get_pm_pars  --- Converts moments into point-mass parameters.

gen_beta_mwm   --- Generates realization of point-mass MWM   
   betarnd --- Generate beta random variable (Statistics toolbox).

% Hybrid MWM
train_hybrid_mwm --- Finds hybrid (beta + point mass) MWM model for an input data set.

   get_wave_stats --- Calculates wavelet coefficient 2nd-order statistics. 
   get_beta_pars --- Converts 2nd-order statistics into beta parameters.

   get_moment_stats --- Calculates signal moments (2nd and -1st).
   get_pm_pars  --- Converts moments into point-mass parameters.
